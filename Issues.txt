Drones:
- collision resolve
    - priority
    - speed

- collision checking
    - reduce number of checks a drone must do by only checking adjacent (ish) positions
        perhaps using graphs?

- starting protection

- paths in opposite directions
    - hot to resolve

- if there is a collision very shortly after another this is bad because it won't detect it
